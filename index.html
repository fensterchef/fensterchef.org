    <p>
    Fensterchef is <b>the</b> X11 tiling window manager.
    With its high configurability, anyone can turn fensterchef into the window
    manager of their dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am thepsauce, currently developing fensterchef on my own.
    Since this website is in progress, I would like to share some words about my
    plans.
    Fensterchef 2.0 is coming with an advanced and efficient scripting language.
    It might take a month.
    If you want a specific date, it should be the <b>1st June 2025</b>.
    The currently developing branch can be found at
    <a href="https://github.com/thepsauce/fensterchef/tree/developing">
      Fensterchef
    </a>.
    Once I am done with that, I will also update this website and add the
    documentation here.
    </p>
    <p>
    Plans are there to make fensterchef work on Wayland but those will only be
    touched after the release of fensterchef version 2.0.
