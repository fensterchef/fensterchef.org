      Fensterchef-wm is a fast and flexible
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager">tiling window manager</a>.
      It is the original and most complex product hence we refer to it as just
      "fensterchef".
      </p>

      <p>
      Fensterchef currently only has an X11 backend but plans are there to port
      it to Wayland compatible with previous configuration.
      </p>

      <p>
      This document is a guide to the fensterchef window manager.

      <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
      <p>
      Depends on: X11, Xrandr&geq;1.2, Xcursor and Xft
      </p>

      <h3>Build from source</h3>

      <p>
      Building requires: coreutils, gzip, pkgconf, a C99 compiler and a unix shell
      </p>

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/fensterchef/fensterchef.git &amp;&amp;
cd fensterchef &amp;&amp;
sudo ./make install &amp;&amp;
fensterchef --version
</pre>

      <h3>Using an <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers">AUR helper</a></h3>
<pre>
pacaur -S <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fensterchef">fensterchef</a>
</pre>

      <h2 id="setup">Setting up</h2>
    
      <p>
      For most <b id="glossary:display-manager">display managers</b>
      like LigthDM, GDM, SLiM etc., it suffices to edit
      <code>~/.xsession</code>:
      </p>
<pre>
exec /usr/bin/fensterchef
</pre>
      <p>
      When using no display manager, use
      <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/xinit">your preferred way</a>.
      </p>

      </p>

      <h2 id="start">Getting started</h2>
      <p>
      You get a <b id="glossary:default-configuration">default configuration</b>
      baked into the executable.
      But we also supply one in text at
      <a href="https://github.com/fensterchef/fensterchef/blob/main/config">github</a>.
      Place it at <code>~/.config/fensterchef/config</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Within the configuration, look for the default modifier which is defined
      as <code>Mod4</code> by <code>alias mod = Mod4</code>.
      It is the prefix of most button and key bindings you can use in fensterchef.
      </p>
      <div class="hint">
      To see what key <code>Mod4</code> corresponds to, use
      <code>xmodmap -pm</code>.
      It usually is <code>Super_L</code>.
      </div>
      <div class="note">
      From now on, we will refer to your
      <b id="glossary:default-modifier">default modifier</b>
      as <code>mod</code>.
      </div>
      <h3 id="set-terminal">Set the terminal emulator</h3>
      <p>
      To use your preferred <b id="glossary:terminal">terminal</b>, make an
      environment variable called TERMINAL and set it to the executable of your
      terminal emulator.
      <br>
      Configure this in your shell.  Usually, editing <code>~/.profile</code>
      suffices.
      </p>
      <p>
      Alternatively, make a bind in the fensterchef configuration.  Look for
      the line in the supplied configuration that says "terminal".
      The bind could look like:
      <br>
<code>~/.config/fensterchef/config</code>
<pre>
...
# Start a terminal
mod+Return run xterm
...
</pre>
      </p>
      <h3 id="x-session">Start an X session</h3>
      <p>
      Start an X session with fensterchef.
      Fensterchef 2.0 supplies you with notifications and the window list.
      Nothing more.
      </p>

      <h3 id="open-terminal">Open a terminal</h3>
      <p>
      Try your configured binding to open a terminal which is
      <code>mod+Return</code> by default.
      Open a second one and notice how it covers the previous terminal.
      Fensterchef will never split unless told to split.
      However, you can edit the configuration and enable
      <code>auto split</code>.
      Then, whenever a window is shown, it is split off the current window.
      <br>
      To close the terminal windows again, use <code>mod+q</code>.
      To simply hide them to later retrieve them, use <code>mod+minus</code>.
      </p>
      <div class="hint">
      No need to restart fensterchef.
      Edit the configuration file and hit the <code>reload configuration</code>
      binding <code>mod+Shift+r</code> to reload at runtime.
      </div>

      <h3 id="make-windows-float">Make windows float</h3>
      <p>
      Open a terminal and press <code>mod+Shift+space</code> to make a window
      float.
      It will be above the tiling windows on a separate layer.
      <br>
      The floating window mode can be toggled by pressing the binding again.
      </p>
      <p>
      You may notice that an empty area is left behind when making a window
      float.
      To automatically remove such areas, turn on <code>auto remove void</code>
      or the more aggressive <code>auto remove</code>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="navigate-tiling">Navigate the tiles</h3>
      <p>
      You can directly split a frame using <code>mod+v</code> for a left and
      right split or <code>mod+s</code> for a top and bottom split.
      To focus the split frames, use the home row keys <code>hjkl</code> or
      arrow keys together with <code>mod</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
      You can also swap frames around using <code>mod+Shift</code> together
      with a directional key.
      There is another way.
      Instead of swapping frames, fensterchef can move them around.
      You can configure this behaviour like this:
<code>~/.config/fensterchef/config</code>
<pre>
...
# Move frames around
mod+Shift+h move left
mod+Shift+j move down
mod+Shift+k move up
mod+Shift+l move right
mod+Shift+Left move left
mod+Shift+Down move down
mod+Shift+Up move up
mod+Shift+Right move right
...
</pre>
      </p>

      <h2 id="make-specific-float">Make specific windows float</h2>
      <p>
      Fensterchef has a concept called <b id="glossary:relation">relations</b>.
      It allows you to bind specific actions to a specific window resource name
      and class.
      To find out which resource name and class a window has, use
      <code>xprop</code>.
      When you start <code>xprop</code> in a terminal, you are able to select
      a window by clicking on it with the mouse.
      You will be printed with all properties the window has.
      Look for <code>WM_CLASS</code>.
      This has two values, one is the instance name (resource name) and the
      other the class name.
      To create a relation to make firefox float, use:
<pre>
# Make the main firefox window float
relate Navigator, firefox set floating, focus window
</pre>
      The relation is two comma separated string and corresponds with what you
      see at <code>WM_CLASS</code>.
      It actually is a glob pattern string.
      You can use shell like matching.
      For example:
<pre>
# Make all firefox windows float
relate *, firefox set floating, focus window

# Can be abbreviated as
relate firefox set floating, focus window
</pre>
      The <code>focus window</code> is needed because you completely overwrite
      the default behavior.
      Omitting it would make firefox not open at all and stay hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
      The concept of relations can also be used to give specific windows
      different border sizes and colors:
<pre>
# Give Xterm a 1 border but all other windows a border size of 3
border size 3
relate xterm border size current 1, focus window
</pre>
      </p>
      <div class="warn">
      Unlike shells, quoting patterns does not make their meaning go away.
      Use a backslash to escape special pattern characters.
      </div>
      <div class="note">
      Window properties are also used by fensterchef internally to figure out
      which window mode a window should be in by default.
      </div>

      <h2 id="frame-vs-window">Frame vs Window</h2>
      <p>
      Frames refer to the partitioning of your screen into rectangular areas.
      As you noticed, these areas may or may not <i>contain</i> a window.
      A window internally is a wrapper around an X window.
      The <b>clients</b> you start like an e-mail program or browser may spawn
      such windows.  Windows can also be <b>dialogs</b>.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
      <b id="glossary:frame">Frames</b> are rigid areas meant for consistent window positioning.
      <br>
      <b id="glossary:window">Windows</b> are spawned by your applications.
      </div>

      <h2 id="frame-window-numbers">Frame and Window numbers</h2>
      <p>
      Both frames and windows have a <b id="glossary:number">number</b>.
      The numbers of frames are unique whereas multiple windows can share the
      same number.
      You can freely assign a number to a frame or window.
      Let us consider an example setup:
<pre>
# Give two specific windows a specific number but do not show them
relate Navigator, firefox assign window 1
relate chat-service assign window 2

# When mod+1/2 is pressed, focus window number 1/2
mod+1 focus window 1
mod+2 focus window 2

# Start the applications
run firefox
run chat-service
</pre>
      Both firefox and the chat service of choice will open in the background.
      They can then be selected using <code>mod+1/2</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
      When a window with a specific number is shown and a frame with the same
      number exists, the window is shown in that frame.
      Let us use this property to create a specific layout:
<pre>
# Give two specific windows a specific number but do not show them
relate Navigator, firefox assign window 1
relate chat-service assign window 2

# If mod+F1 is pressed in any frame, create a split with firefox
# on the left and the chat-service on the right
mod+F1 (
  split horizontally
  assign 1
  move right
  assign 2

  run firefox
  run chat-service
)
</pre>
      </p>

      <h2 id="window-layers">Window layers</h2>
      <p>
      There are three layers that hold onto different window modes.
      The desktop layer is at the bottom and holds onto desktop windows.
      The tiling layer holds onto tiling windows.
      At the top is the floating window holding onto the rest:
      Floating, dock and fullscreen windows.
      When you have a tiling window and a floating window, you can switch
      between them using <code>mod+space</code>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="window-modes">Window modes</h2>
      <p>
      You now already know two window modes:
      <b id="glossary:tiling">Tiling</b> and
      <b id="glossary:floating">floating</b>.
      The other window modes are:
      <b id="glossary:fullscreen">Fullscreen</b>,
      <b id="glossary:dock">dock</b> and
      <b id="glossary:desktop">desktop</b>.
      When a window is <b id="glossary:mapping">mapped</b>
      (about to be shown on screen), fensterchef decides based on the window's
      internal properties what mode it should be in initially.
      When you start a video game, it usually starts as fullscreen.
      Dialog windows usually start as floating windows.
      Other windows like bars are dock windows and then there are the desktop
      windows in the back of everything.
      The rest gets assigned the tiling window mode.
      </p>
      <p>
      You can already make a tiling window a floating window and vise versa.
      Now try to make it fullscreen using <code>mod+f</code>.
      You will notice the window covers the entire screen.
      Use <code>mod+f</code> again to put it back in its original state.
      </p>
      <div class="warn">
      While focusing a floating or fullscreen window, all bindings for frames
      still work the same way.  You are able to control what you can not see.
      </div>

      <h2 id="window-list">Window list</h2>
      <p>
      Use <code>mod+w</code> to open the window list.
      You are presented with a window showing all currently managed windows.
      This excludes windows that do not want to receive focus.
      You can see the window mode indicated by a letter if the window is
      visible.
      If the window is focused, it is indicated by a <code>*</code>.
      If the window is hidden, you see a <code>-</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Use the home row keys <code>hjkl</code> or the arrow keys to navigate
      the list.
      When over a window, use <code>Return</code> to show and focus selected
      window.
      To simply hide the window again without focusing another window, use
      <code>q</code> or <code>Escape</code>.
      </p>
      <div class="hint">
      While the window list is open, you can still use all bindings with
      <code>mod</code>.  See how the window list does live updates.
      </div>

      <h2 id="frame-stash">Frame stash</h2>
      <p>
      You can remove frames using <code>mod+r</code>.
      They are not actually removed but put into the
      <b id="glossary:frame-stash">frame stash</b>.
      You can pop frames from this stash using <code>mod+o</code>.
      This swaps out the current frame with the stashed frame.
      Empty frames will never be stashed.
      </p>
      <p>
      Similar to stash options is <code>mod+n/p</code>.
      These two bindings replace the current frame similar to
      <code>mod+o</code>.
      But they do not place the last popped frame into the current frame.
      Instead, they place the window with higher/lower id into the current
      frame.
      Imagine you have two windows, a terminal and a browser window.
      The terminal has id 88 and the browser has id 92.
      When the browser is invisible, the terminal is a focused tiling window,
      then <code>mod+n</code> will select the browser window.
      Then pressing <code>mod+p</code> will invert this.
      </p>

      <h2 id="parent-child">Parent and child frames</h2>
      <p>
      When you split a frame, you get 3 frames in total.
      One is the parent frame and the other two the left and right child frames.
      You can switch between the children but it is also possible to select the
      parent using <code>mod+a</code>.
      When a parent is selected, you can use <code>mod+b</code> to go back to
      the child frame.
      A parent frame is like any other frame and can be moved, stashed or
      resized.
      </p>

      <h2 id="multiple-screens">Multiple screens</h2>
      <p>
      We will refer to a physical output device as
      <b id="glossary:monitor">monitor</b>.
      Fensterchef recognizes your monitor setup using <b>Xrandr</b>.
      You are required to configure your monitors through
      <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xrandr">Xrandr</a>.
      Fensterchef will recognize any changes you do at runtime.
      There is one configuration option you could bind to move windows to
      specific monitors:
<pre>
# Move the current window to a monitor called HDMI-A-0
mod+Shift+1 center window to HDMI-A-0
# Or one called DVI-D-2
mod+Shift+2 center window to DVI-D-2
</pre>
      </p>
